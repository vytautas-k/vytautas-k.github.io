        # What Is Version Control Systems?

        ## Version control systems are a **category of software tools** that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. 

        * Keeps track of every modification to the code
        * Allows to turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code
        * Helps fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members

        ???
        * Tracks every individual change by each contributor and helps to prevent concurrent work from conflicting
        * VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System)

        ---
        # What Good VCS Should Do?

        * Support a developer's preferred workflow without imposing one particular way of working
        * Work on any platform, rather than dictate what operating system or tool chain developers must use
        * Facilitate a smooth and continuous flow of changes to the code

        ???
        * Frustrating and clumsy mechanism of file locking
        * Giving the green light to one developer at the expense of blocking the progress of others

        ---
        # But I Don't Need VCS!

        ## You can code without any VCS, but then you need to:

        * know which changes are available to users
        * not make any incompatible changes between components
        * keep track of changes in files by adding crazy sufixes like "first", "final", "done", etc.
        * comment out some code which might be needed later

        # Differences Between VCS

        ![](images/gifs/differences.gif)

        ---
        # Types Of Version Control Systems

        * Local Data Model
          * Revision Control System (RCS)
          * Source Code Control System (SCCS)
        * Client-Server Model
          * Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
          * Subversion (SVN)
          * Vesta

        ???
        * Local Data Model
          * backward or interleaved deltas
        * Client-Server Model
          * Concurrent Versions System (CVS) – originally built on RCS
            * CVSNT – cross-platform port of CVS
            * OpenCVS – CVS clone, with emphasis put on security and source code correctness
          * Subversion (SVN) – versioning control system inspired by CVS
          * Vesta – build system with a versioning file system and support for distributed repositories

        ---
        # Concurrent Versions System (CVS)

        * Has been in use for many years (mature technology)
        * Moving or renaming files does not include a version update
        * Security risks from symbolic links to files
        * No atomic operation support, leading to source corruption
        * Branch operations are expensive (not designed for long-term branching)

        ???
        * CVS is the grandfather of revision control systems
        * It was first released in 198

        ---
        # Apache Subversion (SVN)

        * Newer system based on CVS
        * Still contains bugs relating to renaming files and directories
        * Includes atomic operations
        * Does not use peer-to-peer model
        * Wide variety of plug-ins for IDEs
        * Slower comparative speed

        ???
        * Is used at SourceForge, Apache, Python, Ruby
        ---
        # Mercurial
        
        * Distributed model
        * No merging of two parents
        * Extension-based rather than scriptability
        * Less out of the box power
        * Good documentation

        ???
        * Was developed to compete with Git for Linux kernel development
        * Used at OpenOffice.org

        ---
        # Git

        * Distributed, peer-to-peer model
        * Dramatic increase in operation speed
        * Fast branch operations
        * Full history tree available offline
        * Learning curve for those used to SVN

        ???
        * Developed by Linus Torvalds of Linux (2005-07-11)
        * Used on Android, Drupal 

        ---
        # Tools You Can Use With VCS

        ## There are lots of tools for developers, which support one or multiple VCS. As in example, you can use:
        * Tortoise CVS/SVN
        * Eclipse
        * NetBeans
        * Meld
        * Xcode

        # What's Special About Git?

        * Uses stream of snapshots instead of list of file-based changes
        * Like a mini filesystem with build in tools
        * Nearly every operations are local
        * Uses checksums (hashes) for integrity
        * Has 3 main states: committed, modified, and staged

        # The 3 Main Sections Of A Git Project

        .center[
          ![](images/git-states.png)
        ]

        ???
        * Git directory - metadata and object database of project
        * Working tree - a single checkout  
        * The staging area - stores information about what will go into your next commit

        # Git Install & Config

        ### Install (on Ubuntu/Debian)
        ```dos
        sudo apt-get update

        ### Check config
        ```dos
        git config --list
