        # Project guidelines (1/2)

        * Students needs to create working application by implementing given user stories
        * Application code should be written using code standards (PSR-1/PSR-2) as much as possible

        # Project guidelines (2/2)

        * Code should be tested using PHPUnit tests
        * English language should be used:
          * to define tasks on Trello task manager
          * in commit messages, merge requests on GIT
          * throughout whole code

        # Project description

        ### Students should create web application for car service by implementing defined basic user stories.

        ### Project requirements are defined in user stories, which are high-level definitions of a requirement, containing just enough information for developers.

        ### As a first step, given user stories should be split into smaller tasks and added into task management system (Trello).

        ### And only then, after planning stage, students should begin development phase.
